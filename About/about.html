          <h1>IndianOil for Community (CSR)</h1>
          IndianOil has been actively engaged in a gamut of social welfare/upliftment activities across the nation, in
          addition to reaching essential fuels viz. Kerosene, LPG, Petrol, Diesel, etc. to the nook and corner of the
          country. IndianOil’s key Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) thrust areas include 'Safe drinking water and
          protection of water resources', 'Healthcare and sanitation', 'Education and employment-enhancing vocational
          skills', 'Empowerment of women and socially/economically backward groups', etc. IndianOil has a long standing
          CSR
          legacy, which started much before the CSR legislation (Companies Act, 2013) came into force in 2014-15. The
          CSR
          projects of IndianOil are undertaken mostly for improving the quality of life in various communities, which
          invariably include marginalized / underprivileged sections of the society, viz. schedule caste, schedule
          tribe,
          other backward caste, physically handicapped. etc. With the Pan-India presence, IndianOil undertakes CSR
          activities across the country, from Leh in J&K in the North, to the North Eastern States, to the aspirational/
          backward districts/ naxal affected areas, to Gujarat in the West and Tamil Nadu/Kerala in the South. For the
          year
          2018-19, entire CSR budget allocation of Rs. 490.60 crore was spent, thereby achieving 100% budget
          utilization.

            CSRL Super 30
            Our Flagship project, CSRL Super 30, transforms lives of engineering aspirants by providing them with one
            year
            of free residential coaching and mentorship for admission to IITs, NITs, etc.

            This initiative began in 2009 when the first CSRL Super 30 unit was established in Kanpur with support from
            GAIL
            India Ltd. The success of this program fuelled the opening of 2 more units in 2010 and today there are 20
            units
            (spread across UP, Delhi, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kashmir and Uttarakhand
            where more than 750 students are receiving the benefit.

            The well-thought-out system of Residential Mentoring focuses on a one-to-one relationship with our students
            and
            enables us to invest in their holistic development. Other than the core focus area of academics, we leave no
            stone unturned in doing various training and capacity development workshops. Meticulous efforts are made to
            mould them into empowered and cognizant individuals.

            This process teaches them life lessons, makes them great team players and acquaints them well with societal
            issues. Headway for a competitive environment is made where there is ample scope to learn from the peer
            group.

            We always believe in going the extra mile by inculcating values to bring about a profound transformation in
            the
            lives of our students and expect the total number of annual beneficiaries to reach 1000 which is ~800 today.
